            <Text>1. EACH PLAYER STARTS BY PLACING AN ANTE BET. BET MUST BE IN THE RANGE OF $5-25.</Text>
            <Text>2. THE OPTIONAL 'PAIR PLUS' BET WILL PAY OUT IF THE PLAYER'S HAND IS AT LEAST A PAIR OF 2'S. BET MUST BE IN THE RANGE OF $5-25.</Text>
            <Text>3. AFTER ALL BETS ARE MADE, THREE CARDS ARE DEALT TO EACH PLAYER AND THE DEALER. THE DEALER'S CARDS ARE FACE DOWN.</Text>
            <Text>4. WITHOUT KNOWING THE DEALER'S CARDS, EACH PLAYER MUST DECIDE IF THEY PLAY OR FOLD. FOLDING RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF ALL BETS.</Text>
            <Text>5. IF THE PLAYER WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE, THEY MUST PLACE A 'PLAY' WAGER EQUAL TO THEIR ANTE BET.</Text>
            <Text>6. THE DEALER THEN SHOWS THEIR CARDS. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES:</Text>
            <VBox fx:id="subText">
                <Text>A) THE DEALER HAS A HAND LOWER THAN A QUEEN HIGH.</Text>
                <Text>-> IN THIS CASE, THE PLAY WAGER IS RETURNED AND THE ANTE BET IS PUSHED TO THE NEXT HAND.</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>B) THE DEALER HAS A HAND EQUAL OR HIGHER THAN A QUEEN HIGH.</Text>
                <Text>-> IN THIS CASE EACH PLAYER'S HAND STILL IN PLAY IS EVALUATED AGAINST THE DEALER.</Text>
                <Text>-> IF THE DEALER WINS, THE PLAYER LOSES BOTH THE ANTE AND PLAY WAGER.</Text>
                <Text>-> IF THE PLAYER WINS, THEY ARE PAID BACK 1:1 (DOUBLE THAN WHAT THEY WAGERED).</Text>
